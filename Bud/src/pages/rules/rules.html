        </ion-card-header>
        <ion-card-content>
            MCAST is first and foremost an Educational Institution, and thus, it is very important that students
            ensure they come wearing the appropriate attire. With increasing emphasis on corporate image, many
            employers regard workplace attire as serious business. MCAST students are preparing themselves for
            the world of work, where first impressions are very important. These are transmitted through one’s
            attire, amongst other things. <br><br>
            For this reason, the following attire is not allowed:
            <br>
            Sleeveless vests; T-Shirts with bold, extravagant, offensive pictures and/or words; low cut tops or short
            ones that expose the midriff; transparent, see-through or skimpy clothing; torn or frayed jeans; shorts
            (knee length Bermuda shorts are allowed in certain locations, although long trousers are a must in
            workshop settings); caps or other headgear, as well as excessive earrings and piercings (which are to
            be removed in class); short skirts (anything above the knee); very tight skirts and trousers; leggings
            and/or jeggings. Also, underwear should not be visible.
            <br><br>
            Flip-flops, or similar footwear, constitute a safety hazard, besides being considered inappropriate for
            an educational institution preparing students to work in particular environments.

              MOBILE PHONES AND ELECTRONIC DEVICES
          </ion-card-header>
          <ion-card-content>
              Unauthorized use of personal electronic devices is prohibited at all times.
              <br><br>
              Mobile phones should be kept switched off, and left in bags during lectures unless instructed
              otherwise by the lecturer. No mobile phone, or any other similar device (with the exception of
              laptops), may be charged using any of the Institute’s power supply outlets.
              <br><br>
              Failure to abide by these regulations will result in the possible confiscation of the device, which will
              only be returned after the necessary disciplinary action has been taken.
              <br><br>
              Students are reminded that the misuse of electronic devices might result in harmful situations, both
              physical (e.g. misuse of electronic tools or similar devices), and emotional (e.g. using mobile phones
              for bullying or harassment purposes), and in many instances, such use might have legal implications.

              HEALTH AND SAFETY
          </ion-card-header>
          <ion-card-content>
              MCAST takes Health and Safety issues very seriously, and is committed to complying with all
              applicable requirements for the safety of students and staff.
              <br><br>
              Therefore, Health and Safety regulations should be adhered to at all times, by both students and staff,
              while at the Institute. Failure to observe these regulations may result in serious consequences. If one is
              in doubt regarding any of the regulations, please ask! It is everybody’s responsibility to ensure that s/
              he abides by the Health and Safety regulations and to report any shortcomings one may be aware of. 
              <br><br>
              Please note:
              •	 Anyone caught tampering with Health and Safety equipment will face disciplinary action,
              as this will be regarded as a severe breach of conduct. Likewise, action will be taken against
              those who are caught tampering with air conditioning controls, power/network outlets, as
              well as Interactive White Boards, related cabling and equipment in lecture rooms.
              •	 Students who suffer from any ailments (e.g. asthma, colour blindness, vertigo, hearing/
              sight impairment, etc.), or are aware of any other personal condition (both temporary and/
              or permanent) that may affect their performance in terms of their own safety and that of
              others, should notify:
              - the Inclusive Education Unit prior to the beginning of the academic year;
              - the lecturer/s during their first lecture at the start of the academic year.

              USE OF EQUIPMENT
          </ion-card-header>
          <ion-card-content>
              Tampering with mechanical and/or electrical appliances is strictly prohibited. Nobody is allowed to
              remove safety guards or in any way alter the original factory design of machines, machine parts, or
              any other equipment.
              <br><br>
              Students are not allowed to use any machines unless permission has been sought beforehand from
              the lecturer on duty, and unless they are under the lecturer’s strict supervision.
              <br><br>
              Any hand tool, machine, or any other form of equipment which develops a fault, is to be immediately
              disconnected, identified, reported, and locked away until repairs are effected by competent personnel
              and the item is declared safe.
              <br><br>
              No personal electrical appliances, such as heaters, etc. may be brought to, or used at the Institute.
              Students are to avoid using electrical extensions. If electrical extensions must be used, they must not
              be allowed to run across the room. The use of long extensions should be avoided since these can be
              dangerous.

            <ion-card-content>
                All students are required to keep the College and Institute environment tidy and safe to use. Therefore,
                appropriate bins should be used to dispose of any rubbish.
                <br><br>
                It is in the interest, and the responsibility, of all students and lecturers to leave the lecture rooms
                in a suitable condition after lessons. Anyone caught vandalizing, dirtying, breaking furniture and/
                or writing on desks, will face disciplinary action. Lecture rooms found in a very dirty state should be
                reported immediately to the Institute’s Administration.
